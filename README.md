# The-Volatility-Entropy-based-Network-VEBN-
The Volatility Entropy-based Network (VEBN) model, which combines the volatility model(garch model, baysian-SV), transfer entropy method, and complex network theory, is proposed to analyze the impact of volatility risk diffusion and explain its intertemporal diffusion mechanism.
Furthermore, risk diffusion metrics were introduced, utilizing the weighted network statistical properties of the VEBN model to assess the intensity of risk propagation within the volatility information network across various extreme periods. 

To ensure the integrity of the research data, the study period spans from July 2, 2007, to December 10, 2021, encompassing 97 secondary industries as classified by Shenwan. The industry index data are sourced from the Qianzhan Database (https://x.qianzhan.com/xdata/), while data for WTI crude oil prices, the USD to CNY exchange rate, and the S&P 500 are obtained from Investing.com (https://cn.investing.com/).
