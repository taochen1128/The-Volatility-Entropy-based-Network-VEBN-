# The-Volatility-Entropy-based-Network-VEBN-
The Volatility Entropy-based Network (VEBN) model, which combines the volatility model(garch model, baysian-SV), transfer entropy method, and complex network theory, is proposed to analyze the impact of volatility risk diffusion and explain its intertemporal diffusion mechanism.
Furthermore, risk diffusion metrics were introduced, utilizing the weighted network statistical properties of the VEBN model to assess the intensity of risk propagation within the volatility information network across various extreme periods.
